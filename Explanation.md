Generative AI Week 9-10 Challenge
The github page shows the generative AI challenge for week 9 - 10. Here provided are some of the outputed pictures we were able to generate with the pokemon data set we used. Our group 4 worked very well together efficiently and we had a blast trying to figure this out. We faced challenges along the way with some of the models, in the end we choose the best one we could do.
